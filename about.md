<h2>Hey Everyone!</h2>

<p>My name is Brian Rease and I am currently studying for my B.S in Computer Science.
I program with Java, but I'm attempting to gain the same proficiency in Python. My current goals 
are to finish my degree (projected Spring 2020) and to land a role as a Software Engineer. In the future I plan 
on pursuing a Masters in Computer Science and learning about Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>I have a full time job in the Cyber field, so I don't have a ton of personal time. I spend a lot of time 
studying and increasing my programming skills, but when I do have free time I enjoy snowboarding and backpacking. 
I'll discuss Game of Thrones and The Office with you for as long as you'd like.</p>
